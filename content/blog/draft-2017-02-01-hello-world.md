Hello world!

Hello there! I'm Kyle. I'm a Computer science major at the university of North Carolina at chapel hill.

So this is my first post. Starting a blog is something I wanted to do for a while, and it's time I finally write some stuff.

To start off, here are some highlights of things I've done recently. Think of this as

- Taking a algorithms and computer organization course. The great thing about it is that we have access to the Cs server. Ah, is this what it was like to be in the old days? Many people logged in on the same server. University used to be the first exposure people had to computers and the internet. (Eternal August ) Now people each have their own laptop, and using public computers is considered ick.
- some thoughts: I'm obviously too young to have first hand experience about Amiga and commodore and all the old school computers from those days, but
- `friends` command. I'm actually hesitating to post about this, because in the wrong hands it can be used to troll people too much. Nevertheless, I think this is quite a useful thing to have.

- Went to open source 101 conference(link). This is the second technology conference I've been to, the first one being ____(link) last year in 2016. As it was quite an interesting experience and I learned a lot.  I'll try to write up about OS101 and post my notes soon.

- Started attending a competitive programming lecture series. Prepare for next year's ACM ICPC. Expect frequent posts about this.

- Turtle programming. [import from about-me-resnet-presentation]

Winter break:
- Made a Brainf**k interpreter in Ruby. 

This year:
- HackNC (provide link). Watch_Dogs 2
- Heard about UNC Game Jam
  - provide link
  - Reviews

Ideas:
- ASM. Ah, back in middle school we used to program on the TI-84.
- CPLS day 1, 2, 3, 4, ____
- Meme economy

Some things I'm doing for fun:
Stenography. Plover.

- Raspberry Pi
