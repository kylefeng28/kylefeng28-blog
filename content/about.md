Hello! I'm Kyle, a computer science major at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
I'm interested in using technology to better people's lives, especially in the field of accessibility.
On this site, I'll share things that I learn and things that I make on my [Blog][].
You can also find me on [Github][].

Some of the things I do for fun include
playing violin and making random stuff (find some on the [Playground][]).
