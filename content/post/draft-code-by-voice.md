I don't know about you, but [Tavis Rudd's Presentation at Pycon 2015](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SkdfdXWYaI) blew my mind. *So you can do that sort of stuff, without your hands?*

...

Well, it turns out that the Dragonfly library that Tavis uses only supports Dragon NaturallySpeaking and Windows Speech Recognition. What about people who don't use Windows? Tavis himself uses OS X to code, and has a virtual machine running Windows and Dragon NaturallySpeaking with a bridge [relay?] to connect to Dragonfly on OS X.



Apparently people did get frustrated by this complicated setup and lack of native speech recognition frameworks, so [someone] made [voicecode.io](). It's still proprietary though.
